# Verbatim Brand Identity
## Comprehensive Branding & CI Guide

## Brand Essence

**Brand Promise:** Give everyone their say. Find what matters.

**Key Attributes:**
- Human-centered (warm for respondents)
- Rigorous (precise for analysts)  
- Scaling (enterprise-ready)
- Grounded (real words, real insights)
- Trustworthy (scientific credibility)

## Logo Concepts

### Primary Direction: "Verbatim" Wordmark

**Concept 1: Typewriter Echo**
```
verbatim
________
```
- Monospace typeface (references typewriter, "word-for-word")
- Subtle underline suggests emphasis/quotation
- Clean, modern execution (not vintage)
- Professional yet distinctive

**Concept 2: Quoted Speech**
```
"verbatim"
```
- Custom quotation marks that feel conversational
- Serif or sophisticated sans-serif
- Quotation marks slightly oversized, in accent color
- Directly references "exact words"

**Concept 3: Speech Flow**
```
ver|ba|tim
```
- Typography with subtle wave/rhythm
- Separators suggest conversation beats
- Modern, geometric typography
- Visual rhythm mirrors speech patterns

**Recommended: Concept 1 (Typewriter Echo)**
- Most distinctive and memorable
- Balances professional + human
- Scales well across applications
- Subtle enough for enterprise, interesting enough to remember

## Visual Language

### Primary Elements

**1. Typography as Image**
- Large pull quotes from actual interviews
- Use Plex Mono for these to emphasize "verbatim" nature
- Example: Big quote in accent color with attribution

**2. Conversational Flow Diagrams**
- Simple line drawings showing conversation branches
- Not flowcharts - organic, flowing
- Minimal, hand-drawn feel (but clean)
- Shows AI adapting to responses

**3. Pattern Recognition Viz**
- Abstract representations of themes emerging from data
- Dots/nodes clustering
- NOT busy dashboards - elegant, minimal
- Shows insight emerging from conversation

**4. Minimal Photography (if used)**
- Real people in natural settings
- Close-ups suggesting conversation/listening
- Avoid: stock photos of "business meetings"
- Prefer: candid, documentary style

### Elements to AVOID
- Robot icons, AI brains, circuit boards
- Generic survey/form imagery  
- Busy dashboards and data viz
- Tech startup clichés (gradient meshes, 3D elements)
- Cold, clinical aesthetics

## Website Structure

### Homepage Hierarchy

**1. Hero Section**
```
[Logo: verbatim]

Talk to everyone.
Find what matters.

Skip the survey. Run interviews at scale that reveal 
what people really care about.

[CTA: See How It Works] [CTA: Book Demo]
```

**2. The Problem (Plain Language)**
```
Surveys miss the story.
Interviews don't scale.
You're left guessing.

Traditional surveys give you numbers without meaning.
A handful of interviews can't capture the whole picture.
You need both depth and breadth.
```

**3. The Verbatim Approach**
```
Three sections, side by side:

1. Ask People What They Know
   [Simple visual: conversation bubbles flowing]
   Your AI interviewer adapts to each person.
   Real conversations, not rigid questions.
   
2. Talk to Everyone  
   [Visual: spreading network]
   Run hundreds or thousands of interviews.
   Reach people where they are.
   
3. Find the Needle in the Haystack
   [Visual: patterns emerging]
   AI identifies themes and patterns.
   Backed by actual quotes and context.
```

**4. Use Cases (Enterprise Focus)**
```
- Employee engagement (beyond annual surveys)
- Customer research (understand, don't guess)
- Policy feedback (give constituents a real voice)
- Market research (find unmet needs)
```

**5. Why This Works**
```
Two columns:

For Respondents:              For Your Team:
It feels like a conversation  Rich, analyzable data
People actually engage        Patterns across thousands
They can explain fully        Context for every insight
                             Scientific rigor at scale
```

**6. Trust & Credibility**
```
Used by: [Enterprise logos if available]

Built on:
- Research methodology
- Data security standards
- Privacy-first design
```

**7. CTA Section**
```
Ready to hear what people really think?

[Book a Demo] [View Sample Report]
```

- Integration options

**Use Cases:**
- Separate pages or sections for each vertical

- "What you'll learn" for each

**Methodology:**

- How the AI works (demystified)
- Quality assurance
- Comparison to traditional methods

**Security & Privacy:**
- Enterprise-grade commitments
- Compliance standards
- Data handling

## Key Messaging Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

**DO:**
- Use plain language
- Be direct and clear
- Explain simply
- Show, don't tell (examples > claims)
- Acknowledge real research challenges

**DON'T:**
- Use AI buzzwords ("leverage AI to unlock insights")
- Make it sound easy/magical
- Oversell or hype
- Use jargon without explanation
- Be too casual (this is serious work)

### Sample Copy Snippets

**Headlines:**
- "Talk to everyone. Find what matters."
- "Give everyone their say."
- "Ask people what they know."
- "Real conversations. Real scale."
- "Skip the survey. Start talking."

**Body Copy Style:**
```
Bad: "Leverage our AI-powered platform to unlock 
deep customer insights at scale"

Good: "Run real interviews with hundreds of people. 
Our AI asks follow-up questions, listens to what 
matters, and helps you find patterns you'd miss."
```

**Feature Descriptions:**
```
Bad: "Intelligent adaptive questioning engine"
Good: "The AI interviewer follows up when someone 
says something interesting"

Bad: "Advanced thematic analysis"
Good: "Find common themes across all your interviews"
```

## UI Design Principles

### Layout
- Generous whitespace (breathing room)
- Clear hierarchy (large headers, distinct sections)
- Asymmetric but balanced layouts
- Content-first (let the words lead)

### Components
- Simple, obvious buttons (no mystery CTAs)
- Clean forms (minimal fields, clear labels)
- Cards with subtle shadows (depth without 3D)
- Generous padding (never cramped)

### Motion (if any)
- Subtle, purposeful
- Fade-ins on scroll
- Never distracting
- Can animate text appearing (typewriter effect) sparingly

### Accessibility
- WCAG AA minimum (AAA for body text)
- Color contrast checked rigorously  
- Never rely on color alone
- Clear focus states

---

## Brand Applications

### Business Cards
- Wordmark front and center
- Monospace font creates distinctive look
- Contact info in Inter
- Accent color used sparingly

### Email Signatures
```
[Name]
[Role] • verbatim

[email] • verbatim.com
```
Simple, clean, professional.

### Report Templates
- Clean, readable layouts
- Pull quotes in Plex Mono + accent color
- Generous margins
- Interview excerpts clearly attributed
- Data visualizations in brand colors

### Slide Decks
- One idea per slide
- Large typography
- Minimal bullet points
- Use actual quotes as visual elements
- Accent color for emphasis only

## Competitive Differentiation

### Visual Position

**vs. Survey Tools (Qualtrics, SurveyMonkey):**
- Less form-like, more conversational
- Warmer, more human
- Shows depth not just breadth

**vs. Qual Research Firms:**
- More modern, systematic
- Scientific rigor front and center
- Shows scale capability

**vs. AI/Tech Startups:**
- Less flashy, more grounded
- Emphasize human element
- Trustworthy over disruptive

**Result:** Verbatim occupies unique space - human-centered but rigorous, conversational but scientific, modern but trustworthy.

---

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. **Finalize color palette** (test in various contexts)
2. **Commission/create wordmark** with selected typeface
3. **Build component library** (buttons, cards, forms)
4. **Write homepage copy** (test messaging with target users)
5. **Create 2-3 sample visuals** (conversation flow, pattern emergence)
6. **Design 1-2 key pages** fully to establish system
7. **Create brand guidelines doc** for team/contractors

---

## Sample Visual Mockups Needed

To bring this to life, you'll want:

1. **Hero section** with wordmark and headline
2. **"How it works" diagram** showing conversational flow
3. **Sample report page** showing insight + quotes
4. **Feature card** component design
5. **Mobile responsive** views
6. **Email template**

Would you like me to elaborate on any section or create specific mockup guidelines?

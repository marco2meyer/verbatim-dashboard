Every design decision, every word choice, every color—it all serves that core idea. When in doubt, ask: "Does this help people understand that we're about real human conversation at meaningful scale?" If yes, you're on brand. If no, reconsider.

The documents in this package give you everything you need to build a distinctive, trustworthy brand that positions verbatim exactly where it needs to be: the unique intersection of human depth and quantitative rigor.

Good luck building something great.

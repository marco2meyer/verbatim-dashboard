# Verbatim Messaging & Copy Guide

## Voice Principles

The verbatim voice is:
- **Direct:** Get to the point. No fluff.
- **Plain:** Use everyday language. Avoid jargon.
- **Grounded:** Show, don't tell. Use concrete examples.
- **Confident but humble:** We know what we do. We don't oversell.
- **Human-first:** Always remember real people are involved.

## Messaging Frameworks

### Problem → Solution → Result

**Template:**
[Pain point in plain language] → [What we do] → [Specific outcome]

**Examples:**

"Surveys give you numbers without context → Run interviews that feel like conversations → Understand what people actually mean"

"A handful of interviews can't show the whole picture → Talk to hundreds or thousands of people → Find patterns you'd miss with small samples"

"You're stuck choosing between depth and breadth → Get both with AI-powered interviews → Real conversations, real scale"

---

### Feature → Benefit → Why It Matters

**Template:**
[What it does] → [What you get] → [Why this changes things]

**Examples:**

"AI interviewer adapts to each person → Every conversation goes where it needs to → You learn things you'd never think to ask"

"Analyze all interviews at once → Spot themes across thousands of responses → Find the patterns that matter, backed by actual quotes"

"Interview in any language → Reach people where they are → Get perspectives you'd otherwise miss"

---

## Tone in Different Contexts

### Homepage (Confident, welcoming)
"Talk to everyone. Find what matters."

### Product Page (Clear, explanatory)
"Here's how it works: You design the interview. Our AI talks to people. You get the insights."

### Use Case Page (Specific, grounded)
"Last quarter, a retail company used verbatim to interview 847 customers about their shopping experience. They found three pain points that never showed up in their satisfaction surveys."

### About Page (Human, authentic)
"We built verbatim because we were frustrated. Surveys miss the story. Small samples miss the scale. We wanted both."

### Error Messages (Helpful, not cute)
❌ **Bad:** "Oops! Something went wrong 🙈"
✅ **Good:** "We couldn't load your interviews. Try refreshing the page."

### Empty States (Encouraging, clear)
❌ **Bad:** "No data yet!"
✅ **Good:** "You haven't run any interviews yet. Ready to start?"

## Writing Checklist

Before publishing any copy, ask:

□ Did I use any buzzwords? (Remove them)
□ Could this be shorter? (Make it shorter)
□ Would my audience say this? (Match their language)
□ Am I showing or telling? (Show with examples)
□ Did I explain what actually happens? (Be specific)
□ Would I find this helpful if I were the reader? (Be honest)

## Words We Use

**Prefer:**
- Talk / conversation / interview

## Words We Don't Avoid (But Use Carefully)

**AI / Artificial Intelligence:**
- Use when relevant, but don't overuse
- Explain what the AI actually does
- Don't hide behind it or make it sound magical

**Scale / At scale:**
- Fine to use, but be specific about numbers when possible
- "Talk to hundreds" is better than "scale your research"

**Insights:**
- Use sparingly
- Often "findings" or "themes" is more specific

## Social Media Voice

**LinkedIn (Professional but not stiff):**
"Most surveys ask people to rate things on a 1-5 scale. But what does a '3' actually mean? 

With verbatim, people explain in their own words. You get the context, not just the number."

---

**Twitter/X (Punchy, clear):**
"Survey: 'Rate your satisfaction 1-5'
Verbatim: 'Tell me about your experience'

Same goal. Better data."

---

## The Verbatim "No-No" List

Never say:
- "Revolutionary" or "game-changing"
- "Unlock insights"
- "Leverage the power of"
- "Transform your organization"
- "Seamless integration"
- "Unparalleled" or "best-in-class"
- "Solutions" (unless you need to)
- "Ecosystem"
- "Synergy"

If you catch yourself using these, stop and rewrite in plain English.

---

## When In Doubt

Ask yourself: **"Would I say this out loud to someone?"**

If not, rewrite it.

The verbatim voice is how you'd explain your work to a smart colleague over coffee. Clear, direct, no BS.

---

## Quick Reference: Tone Spectrum

**Too Casual:**
"Hey! Ready to totally revolutionize your research game? 🚀"

**Too Corporate:**
"Verbatim enables organizations to leverage AI-powered methodologies for enhanced stakeholder engagement."

**Just Right:**
"Run real interviews with hundreds of people. Find patterns you'd miss with surveys."

---

## Final Reminder

Every word should earn its place. If it doesn't help the reader understand or decide, cut it.

The best verbatim copy is invisible. The reader gets what they need without noticing the writing.
